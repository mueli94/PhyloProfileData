\title{Data package for phylogenetic profile analysis using PhyloProfile tool}
\description{
The MOFAdata package provides a collection of datasets to accompany the
R package MOFA, where they are used to illustrate how to run MOFA and analyse its results.
Briefly, it contains multi-omics data for a bulk study on chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
a single cell scMT-seq study. For these two data sets, we also provide
pretrained MOFA objects to be used in downstream analysis with MOFA.
In addition, various gene sets are stored here, that can be useful when
performing feature set enrichment analysis in MOFA.

An overview of the datasets contained in this package can be found in the vignette "MOFAdata".
